for our project. If you'd like to discuss Psiphon with the community, visit the
[psiphon3-users Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/psiphon3-users).

If you encounter an problem while running Psiphon, please also send us feedback
from within the app, and include diagnostic information.


## Code

We haven't yet received enough code submissions to have come up with detailed
instructions for how to write or submit fixes, features, etc. However, we'd be 
extremely happy for you to help us, so please get in touch with us, or just
submit a pull request and we'll figure it out together.


## Translations

Psiphon always needs translation help! Psiphon is used all over the world, and
primarily in non-English speaking countries. Psiphon is also updated very 
frequently. Those two facts add up to: we need lots of translations, and we
need them updated pretty often. 

[Psiphon's translation project](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/Psiphon3/) 
is hosted on Transifex, which provides an easy web interface for contributing
and reviewing translation. If you speak any language other than English, please
check it out!

We would also appreciate localized screenshots (right now they're almost 
exclusively English). Please contact us to send them to us.


## Documentation

Most of our documentation can be found on [our website](https://psiphon.ca/).
(There's also some in our source code project -- like this document -- but it's
mostly technical.)

For example, check out the [User Guide](https://psiphon.ca/en/user-guide.html),
[FAQ](https://psiphon.ca/en/faq.html), and [Blog](https://psiphon.ca/en/blog/index.html).
If you have any suggestions, improvements, expansions, feedback, etc., please
